    <h1>Homemade Mac and Cheese</h1>

    <p>This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and </p> 
    <p>comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stovetop, starting with</p>
    <p>a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that</p>
    <p>coats every nook and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni and cheese</p>
    <p> casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or alongside a salad for a meatless dinner.</p>
